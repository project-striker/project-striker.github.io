#### Education

**Introduction**

For most of history, children learnt what they needed from the families and community by for example, listening to stories. This is known as informal education. That was before formal education, a new style of education with schools and colleges. Although formal education is "dominant", informal education still continues - the ones outside the classroom. A part of informal education can be seen in the hidden curriculum. Education is an agency of secondary socialization - a period of socialization after primary socialization. Children do not only learn about the lessons but also social expectations.

**School as an agency of Social Control**

Education is an agency of secondary socialization - a period of socialization after primary socialization. Children do not only learn about the formal curriculum but also social expectations.

Moreover, schools act as an agency of social control - the behavior of children is regulated. Sanctions (such as demerits, detention) and rewards (such as merits and recognition and awards) apply. 

**Functions of Education (according to the three main views)**
1. **Functionalism**
    - Like every part of society, functionalists see education as beneficial for the wellbeing of society
    - Schools pass on the norms and values of a society so it is preserved over generations. 
    - They act as agencies of socialization. 
    - Promote individual achievement.
    - Produce people with skills or abilities needed for the economy (known as sifting or sorting)
    - Helps children have a sense of belonging in ways such as  
        - sharing similar experiences
        - singing the national anthem
        - seeing the national flag or other national symbols.  
    - Criticism from marxists
        - There is no set of shared values to be passed on, but rather a dominant ideology 
        - There is no strong link between school and work 
        - People are not selected for jobs by their ability, however by social class such as race, ethnicity, gender, etc.

2. **Marxism**
    - Marxists see education in a negative way. For bourgeoisie, it is a way to make the poor stay poor and the rich stay rich.
    - For the working class:
        - They introduce a common value system which benefits the ruling class.
        - They make them unaware of how they are being used (as part of their false consciousness).
        - Schools make people good workers for the capitalist system so are making them more likely to be exploited.
        - Cultures shared in schools persuade people to work hard and even die for their country in wars
        - Correspondence theory (by Boules & Gintis) – the hidden curriculum prepares children for the world of work.
    - For the ruling class:
        - Different values are being taught to them – such as being taught that they are superior to other classes. 
        - Their schools make it easier to gain access to top universities. 
        - Schools ensure the next generation of the ruling class can inherit wealth from the parents. 

3. **Feminism**
    - Feminists see school as having been affected by two genders.
    - In some countries, education is seen as more important for boys than girls.
    - Feminists see schools as sending the message that boys are superior and girls should lower their expectations. This may happen because: 
        - Girls are taught different knowledge (e.g they might be discouraged from taking harder subjects) 
        - Teachers have high hopes for boys while they assume that the future of girls is domestic work.
        - Head teachers and senior staff are often male, giving the impression that men are suited for leadership roles.
