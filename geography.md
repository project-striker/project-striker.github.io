#### Food security
**General overview**
- Definition
    - When everyone has plenty of access to safe, nutritious food anytime, anywhere.
- Three strands of food security
    - Food availability &rarr;  there is enough food available in a consistent basis
    - Food access &rarr; people have enough resources to obtain food
    - Food use &rarr;  appropriate use of food based on knowledge
- Food surplus is when there is extra food produced.
- Food deficiency is when there is less food produced.

**The problem**

The amount of food we have today is enough to provide everyone with a healthy diet. However, the food is distributed unevenly. Some countries have a food surplus while some countries have a food deficit and do not have the cash to import food. Moreover, subsidies and tariffs by HICs contribute to this inequality. Additionally, multinational companies contribute to the “siphoning” of food production for local markets of LICs to the export market. 

- The three threats of food insecurity in a country are 
    - Pushing people into poverty. 
    - Killing economic gains that took decades to earn.
    - Threatens political stability. 

Food shortage is when a country or area does not have enough food. It can be caused by physical and socio-political factors.
- Physical factors
    - Natural disasters
    - Soil exhaustion
    - Pests and plant diseases
- Socio-political factors
    - Low investment on agriculture
    - Fast rising population
    - Poor logistics
    - Wars/Conflicts

Food shortages hit LICs the hardest as they mostly do not have emergency reserves. In HICs however, there is enough human resources to fight this problem. Food shortages have effects both in the short and long run. Malnutrition means that people are less resistant disease and are more likely to catch one (e.g kwashiorkor: protein deficiency). People who are malnourished never perform at their peak capacity. In the long term, their land may not be tended well, nor other economic activities will be at its most productive. This can be part of the cycle of poverty in LICs.

**Summits**
- 1974, World Food Summit, Rome, addresses the issues of rising populations and food prices may impair the ability to produce enough food for everyone. 
- 1996, World Food summit, Rome, addresses the same things with global warming and genetic engineering 
- 2009, World Summit on Food Security, Rome, addresses the need to boost food productions in disadvantaged areas.
