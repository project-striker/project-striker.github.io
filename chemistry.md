## Term 2

### Topics
- Ionisation energy

#### Ionisation Energy
**General Definition**
- The energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms of an element to form one mole of gaseous ions
- **Remember!** Only **one** mole of electron can be removed at every ionisation energies
- Symbol of IE: \[\Delta H_i\]

**Evidence of IE**
- Ionisation energy was discovered by shooting high speed electron beams at atoms
- Can be seen using an atomic emission spectra
    - Every element's spectra of light has its own characteristic wavelength fingerprints.
    - Discrete photons characteristic of electron jumping energy levels.
    - Can be used analytically.

**Further details**
- Requires energy to remove the electron which makes it an endothermic process
    - Endothermic &rarr; when energy is absorbed from the surroundings (+ve)

**First Ionisation Energy**
\[\Delta H_i1: X_(g_) \rightarrow X^+_(g_) + e^-\]
