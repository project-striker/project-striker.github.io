### Topics
- Ionisation energy

#### Ionisation energy
**General overview**
- The energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms of an element to form one mole of gaseous ions is known as the Ionisation Energy (IE)
- **Remember!** Only **one** mole of electron can be removed at a time.
- Requires energy to remove the electron which makes it an endothermic process (with the symbol being +ve)
    - Endothermic &rarr; when energy is absorbed from the surroundings
- Symbol of Ionisation Energy: \[\Delta H_i\]

**Discovery and evidence**
- IE was discovered by shooting high speed electron beams at atoms.
- Can be seen with an atomic emission spectra
    - Each element has its own characteristic wavelength fingerprint
    - Discrete photons characteristic of electron jumping energy levels
    - Can be used analytically

**IE definitions**
- First IE
    - \[\Delta H_{i1}: X_{(g)} \rightarrow X^+_{(g)} + e^-\]
