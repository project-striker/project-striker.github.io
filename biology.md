#### Biological Molecules
**Proteins**
- Polymers that are made up of amino acid monomers
- Do take note that the sequence, type and number of the amino acids within a protein determines its shape and therefore its function
- Functions of proteins
    - Enzymes
    - Hormones
    - Structural proteins (eg. keratin, collagen)
    - etc.

**Amino acids**
- Monomer of proteins
- 20 amino acids are found in proteins common to all living organisms
- General structure of amino acids are as follows:
    - an amine group -NH<sub>2</sub>
    - a carboxyl group -COOH
    - a hydrogen atom
    - an R group (which what makes each amino acid different from others)

**Peptide bond**
- **Bonding**
    - To form a peptide bond, a **hydroxyl** (-OH) is lost **from a carboxylic group** of one amino acid and a **hydrogen atom** is lost **from an amine group** of another amino acid
    - The remaining atoms then join together to form a peptide bond consisting of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen
    - This process is called **condensation**, which is when water molecules are removed to form a covalent bond which in this case it's peptide bond.
    - When many amino acids are bonded together, the molecule formed is called a polypeptide. A protein could have one chain or multiple of them.

- **Breaking**
    - The process of breaking the peptide bond is called **hydrolisis** with the addition of water into the molecule.
