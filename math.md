- Functions
- Binomial Theorem

#### Functions
**General overview**
- A function is a rule that tells you how to get an output from an input.
- In simpler terms, think of a function as a machine. You put the input (domain), and it gives you the output (range).
- Example: $f(x)=2x$
    - $f$ would be the name of the function (could be any other letter, but generally it's f)
    - $x$ would be the input
    - $2x$ would be the rule (multiply the input by two)
- So, if $x=3$, the expression would be $f(3)=2(3)$
    - The result of the function could be written as $f(3)=6$
- In conclusion, functions is all about **substituting** the value of $x$ with the given input.

**Mapping**
- In essence, mapping is like matching things up. You take one thing and find its match in another place.
- Types of mapping:

- The set of **possible inputs is called a domain**, whereas the set of **possible output is known as a range**
- Function is mapped only by **many to one** or **one to one**

**Domain and Range of Linear Equations**
- Linear equations are equations that form a straight line on the graph.
