### Topics:
- Functions
- Binomial Theorem

#### Functions
**General overview**
- A function is a rule that tells you how to get an output from an input.
- In simpler terms, think of a function as a machine. You put the input (domain), and it gives you the output (range).
- Example: $f(x)=2x$
    - $f$ would be the name of the function (could be any other letter, but generally it's f)
    - $x$ would be the input
    - $2x$ would be the rule (multiply the input by two)
- So, if $x=3$, the expression would be $f(3)=2(3)$
    - The result of the function could be written as $f(3)=6$
- In conclusion, functions is all about **substituting** the variable with the given input.

**Mapping**
- In essence, mapping is like matching things up. You take one thing and find its match in another place.
- Types of mapping:

- Functions are either **one-to-one** or **more-to-one** mapping.

**Domain and Range of Linear Equations**
- A **domain** is a set of **possible inputs.**
- A **range** is a set of **possible outputs from the inputs.**

**Finding range in a linear function**
- If the **gradient is positive**
  - Input the boundaries in the equation. 
  - After you get the output, copy the placement of the variable, the inequality symbols, and input however change it from $x$ to $f(x)$, and write the output instead of the input.
- If the **gradient is negative**
  - Do the same as finding range in a positive gradient, however, reverse the direction of the inequality symbol.
  - If the range has two boundaries, reverse the placement of the outputs instead of changing the direction of the inequality symbol.

**Finding range in a quadratic function**
- Note that you need to convert the quadratic functions to $\pm a(x-b)^2+c$ form.
- If $a$ is positive (smiley face), $f(x)>$
- If $a$ is negative (sad face), $f(x)<$
- If it passes the minimum/maximum point, use $\ge$ or $\le$
