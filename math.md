#### Functions
General overview
- A function is a rule that tells you how to get an output from an input.
- In simpler terms, think of a function as a machine. You put something in (input), and it gives you something out (output).
- Example: $f(x)=2x$
    - $f$ would be the name of the function (could be any other letter, but generally it's f)
    - $x$ would be the input
    - $2x$ would be the rule (multiply the input by two)
- So, if $x=3$, the expression would be $f(3)=2(3)$
    - The result of the function could be written as $f(3)=6$
