#### Business objectives
**Introduction**
- A business objective is a **stated measurable target a business plans to achieve.** It is important for 3 reasons:

- **Maximising short-term revenue** &rarr; Maximising the amount of cash from sales.
- **Increasing shareholder value** &rarr; maximising returns (dividends) to shareholders and increasing share prices.

**Business objectives must be SMART**

- <u>R</u>elevant &rarr; Must make sense when you consider the resources of the business
- <u>T</u>ime-limited &rarr; Must be set within a time frame in order to track changes

**Factors that affect what business objectives will be chosen**
- **Business Culture** &rarr; Culture is a way of doing things that is shared within an organization. For example, if senior managers aggressively pursue profits, the business objectives might be related.
- **Size and legal form of the Business** &rarr; Owners of small businesses might be concerned with their leisure time and choose profit satisficing while directors of corporations might be concerned with growth. 
- **Public or Private sectors** &rarr; Public corporations are usually concerned with quality of services (e.g average delay times in train arrivals), however private corporations are mostly concerned with money.
- **The number of years the business has been operating** &rarr; Startups will always pursue the objective of survival as the failure rate is high. 

**Aim vs Mission statement**
- A business aim is a long-term goal that a business hopes to achieve.
- A mission statement is a sentence that sums up a business aim with an exciting or motivating mood.
- A business aim can help form objectives, but mission statements canâ€™t. However, it still has important functions.
- Benefits of mission statements include:
    - Informing outside groups what the business is about and its aims.
    - Motivating employees and guiding their behavior at work. 
- It's limitations:
    - Too vague
    - Virtually impossible to criticize or analyze.

**Hirearchy of goals**

Business aim must be converted into SMART objectives which must be broken down into departmental and divisional objectives which must be broken down again into individual targets. 

Aims and objectives help managers with making business strategies, a long term plan of action which is designed to achieve a particular objective. Strategies make it easier to decide on what business tactics to take. The short term actions as part of the overall plan.
