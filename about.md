## A message from the developer
Hello everyone! This is Aji, the man behind all this bombshell of a website. It has been an epic journey in the making of this website. From all the nights I stayed up late just to reconfigure git, to the days where I find it hard just to recompile the website due to build issues with GitHub. Anyway, all I gotta say is thank you to everyone of you who have used this to study or just supporting me by providing corrections, notes, or just wishes in general. I do hope by using this website, helps with your studies by at least a small amount. Looking forward to see your scores! Godspeed batch 18!
