### Topics
- Vertical motion equation
- Dynamics
  - Forces and free body diagram

#### Vertical motion equation
**General overview**
- It shares formulas together with horizontal motion equation

| Horizontal motion equation | Vertical motion equation |
| :------------------------: | :----------------------: |
|          $v=u+at$          |         $v=u+gt$         |
|   $d=\frac{1}{2}(v+u)t$    |  $h=\frac{1}{2}(v+u)t$   |
|   $d=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$   |  $h=ut+\frac{1}{2}gt^2$  |
|       $v^2=u^2+2ad$        |      $v^2=u^2+2gh$       |

Note: The only difference is $d\rightarrow h$ and $a\rightarrow g$
- Acceleration of freefall $g$
  - approximately $-9.81m/s^2$ on Earth
  - Why approximate? Because Earth isn't perfectly spherical, so different areas would have different gravitational forces
  - Why negative? Because freefall's direction will always go down (hence why it's free**fall**)

#### Forces and free body diagram
**What is a force?**
- A force is a push or a pull
- Forces require an agent, something that exerts work
- The work is exerted to an object
- In the object's POV, there's a force that is acting on the object

**Gravitational force $F_g$**
- The weight of an object
- Formula: $F_n=m\times g$
- Direction: downwards

**Normal Reaction Force $F_n$**
- The opposite of gravitational force.
- The force is **perpendicular** to the object and the surface.
- Formula: $F_n=m\times g\times cos(\theta)$
